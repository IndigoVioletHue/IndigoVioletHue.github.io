	<p> Hey gamers, sorry its been a while. Been trying to setup a dedicated server all day, plus i started up college again yesterday. Lame as hell. But its whatever. A Level number one is in ~5 weeks, so i should probs stop making my own stuff and knuckle up and get revising, but its never been my style.<br><br>I watched a new anime today, oshi no ko? I'ts fucking incredible. I'm not giving anything away, but its weird to begin with but its worth a watch.<br><br>I'm expecting to be done with the server by friday. So hope you guys look forward to 21/4/23<br><br>short one for the first in what, 2 days? I know, when its all working i'll be more consistent. Still working on it, promise!<br><br>See you nerds all later<br><br>-iv<br> </p>
