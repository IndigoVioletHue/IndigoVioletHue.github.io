	<p> Hey guys. I'm signing off for tonight. I'm currently sat in a call with some friends planning out the summer. I'll tell you more about that a bit later. I'm pretty tired of working on this at this point, i started at like 11am so its like 13 hours later. <br><br>Shoutout to eddie for the pic in the last post by the way, its a great watermark i think. Because of how i write my posts i have to manually change each html file. Whatever, its not me right nows problem.<br><br>Ta for the rad day. Felt productive. Absolutely Wasnt.<br><br>c u <br><br>-iv<br> </p>
