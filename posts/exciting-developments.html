	<p> "Howdy Folks. I'm coming to you live from the all new compiled editor for the bloog. Custom built text editor that can update the blog with the press of a key. I need to do loads of stuff still. I have a plan to add functionality for a mobile app, and create a database to keep track of all the blog entries. also i should probably find a better way to update the front page. Limit it at 5 or something. I dont know. Anyway, i'm gonna post this and then go for a bit. Probably be back tonight. OOO! I'll add a time and date to the bottom oof each blog post. Or the top? Anyway, all future ones after this will have that. Look forward to it i guess. BYE!<br><br>-iv<br>" </p>
