	<p> Howdy gamers, how we gamin? I'm working on the server right now. I've gone for debian and i'm gonna try and set up a PHP server so i can start testing all that jazz for the comments. Im running it all in a virtual box for noow and then when i get the server up and running i'll just copy everything i've done. With the launch of the server, i'll alsoo start working on some way to write and upload poosts from anywhere. Also i really need to fix the organisation of the front page.<br><br>See you after i've made some more progress.<br><br>-iv<br> </p>
