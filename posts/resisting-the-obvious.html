	<p> Howdy again everyone. Its a new day and time to sort out these bloody comments. I could absolutely just use jekyll, but that seems super lame. So i'm trying to find absolutely any way to do it otherwise. Right now i'm thinking about just having a csv with all the comments and a link to each post, then having the JS load the comments when the post is loaded. This is super inefficient though. I could add a seperate DB for each post and store comments like that. Would speed up loading but makes the whole system far more complicated than it needs to be. For now, by the way, 'YAML Ain't making sense' is gonna be the comment sandbox. Because i cant be bothered to tinker with the main template because that'll just be a ballache to fix later.<br><br>I look into jekyll again just now. I dont know ruby at all, soo i'm still going to avoid it. Surely theres a way to do this with pure JS, HTML and CSS? I dont know. Unless i can use a mix of php and js? Well, keep checking the YAML post and you'll see how far i'm getting. I'm not dealing with user accounts just yet. Screw that noise.<br><br>Time for some programming!<br><br>-iv<br> </p>
