	<p> Okay. this is what should hopefully be the final test of the dynamic directory thing i put in so i can finally use this thing on my laptop. Im thinking of having a server that automatically does all this in the future. Like i just drop the file and it'll sort it all out for me. for now though, while im borrowing githubs servers its probably best to only upload stuff when i have too. Stop syncing things every 5 minutes or something<br><br>Anyway, when i'm done with all this i'll do like a personality thing or something IDK. I'm thinking about implementing comments so that should be fun. I've been avoiding javascript so far, but i always knew it would have to come around.<br> -iv </p>
