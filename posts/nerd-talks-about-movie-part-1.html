	<p> Sup folks. Here\'s the obligatory sword art online post.<br><br>I\'ve just started watching the sword art online progressive movie. Aria of a starless night. I know i know, anyone that knows it is saying "oh but they used the manga not the light novel to write it" and i know. It sucks. SAO:P 1 slaps so fucking hard its just a shame that they only used like a quarter of it for E2 of sword art online. I also love mr. kawahara\'s (is that too formal?) to ditch the original story in favour of the revised sao:p one. (i understand he didnt ditch it but its definately revised).<br><br>I have a few comments already. Very petty, but i love this show so much i have to be as picky as possible to find anything. Anyway, onto the first thing. One thing i\'ve really enjoyed about watching each season of SAO is as the budget increases so does the quality, now in my head this was to reflect the development of the technology over time. Like SAO\'s aincrad arc looks worse than the alicisation arcs because the technology is less evolved.<br><br>Woah, hold up. Main character added? Purple hair woman? WHAT? This is mental. Is this gonna be an SAO:P addon? Oh also, i havent actually read the manga but i hope kizmels still there. <br><br>That was a bit ranty. I\'m watching it as i type so i\'m gonna randomly say stuff lolz. The end of the beta test with kirito at the start was cool and all, but i think they used his aincrad character model instead of the initial one we see inSAO e01. Which is not too radical. But again, very petty. Whats up with this purple haired girl then?<br><br>Ohhhhhhhhhh.<br><br>I hope they dont make it out that asuna was like a massive gamer in secret (sidenote gamer is such a cringe word to use i cant handle it non-ironically) because i always loved the story element that was like "i put on the nervegear as an act of rebellion and it changed my life". Maybe i\'m remembering the story wrong. II also thought that asuna like stole her brothers nervegear and he was the one that wanted to play sao but she just took his place or something? I didnt know that she was like actually interested in playing.<br><br>THE BRAIDS<br><br>the origin<br><br>love it.<br><br>IS THIS THE MOMENT? (12:39)<br><br><br>okay lemme watch for a minute be back in a mo.<br><br>NOOOO THEY CHANGED THE BOOTUP SEQUENCE<br><br>WHAT<br>THAT WAS SO GOOD FROM E1<br><br>bruh ur telling me asunas avatar was always asuna<br>bro momentum.<br><br>im so pissed they changed the login sequence man, that was iconic.<br><br>how badass would full dive be irl though like no shot. I\'ve been sending a lot of broken up paragraphs so i\'m gonna type properly for a bit. I\'m a tiny bit excited. brooo okay yeah this is so obviously the manga. story is dumb. apologies. so this is when klein and kirito are attacking those boar yeah? I dont know how this story is gonna develop at all like the SAO:P ln\'s. I thought SAO:P was all about kirito and asuna hanging out for the floors before the moonlit black cats incident. At least they\'ve left in the iron rapier. <br><br>There\'s a load of cool mechanics they introduced in the light novels for SAO:P that i really hope they show here. Because, in my opinion, it really helped to flesh out SAO as a game.<br><br>LOL SIDENOTE mito said the same thing as kirito did. So is it meant to be like the oppoosite? So like mito is the kirito to asunas klein? Thats cool. I like the new intro for ahkihiko kayaba too. Pretty rad. They even kept the same chatter in hahahahaha. Mito is saying very similar stuff to kirito i love it. Why did they use a different VA for kayaba though?<br><br>Holy shit. THis is a long one. Alright, lets stop here<br><br>Thanks fellas.<br><br>-iv<br> </p>
