	<p> Actually so hyppe<br><br>THeres my boy, good old kirigaya. Sucks about mito. Also, how the hell does asuna get the wind fleuret if mito had it? Poor bloke iis too awkward to talk to girls though. He's still a newbie too awwwww. Wait mito is still alive? But she's like convinced asuna is dead or something? Bruh she can see asuna on her map. I swear. Huh this is a dream right? Yeah of course it is its been like weeks at this point. Poor asuna man, but i dont get why neither of them have realised the other is alive? Are they not friends in SAO?<br><br>So mito just dipped? and kirito is not involved at all? That sucks. I mean i know asuna should have character development outside of kirito, but like the storylines from saop are so badass. and they work so well with the main story. I'm only halfway through, i need to be less judgy. Ah yes. i forgot. Asuna the slayer of iron rapiers. This scene is the same as the light novel isnt it? asuna passes out and kirito drags her out in a sleeping bag. Yup! I remember this from the LN. Is this in the Manga or did they smash the two stories together like with saop and sao in the first episode of the original series.<br><br>So they show the first floor boss meeting again? Mental. Good old og nerdy asuna. At least they were true to the books with that. Although i'm a little pissed about the whole asuna learning to switch and being in a party of that, kinda shits on the whole importance of kirito and asuna teaming up in the boss fight. At least they managed to link K & a's interaction in the first episode back into the movie. With different context though, which is cool.<br><br>I hope they get to the boss fight. It'll be cool to see the whole beater interaction from asunas pov. See what she was thinking. Holy crud, mito was there. Is she like a renamed character from the original series? Like i recognise the character but not the name. I'm not sure. Its cool that they made asuna a little less deadpan too. She's not emotionless, she's just not herself completely. Oh my god its the fucking farmhouse i love it.<br><br>This was a pretty good bit from the light novel (aside the weird bit we'll skim over it) but i wonder if they keep argo in? they added the three stage clothe removal too, which is a niche detail from the LN (armor, clothes, undergarments) and i really liked it. I'm  a sucke for cool game design. No argo! Darn. So kirito killed that thing that mito killed? Cwazy g.<br><br>So asuna and mito are chill? idk. mito feels bad it seems though. I hope they mention kiritos monster pk incident too, because imo its pretty important. You know, where the other beta tester tried to kill him just before he got the anneal blade? <br><br>Boss fight time, woop! Good old ilfang. Maybe mito dies in the boss fight? THats what i'm thonkin. Silly diavel. Thats not a talwar, thats an itachi! I iddnt know they had paralysis in the first floor boss fight what the helllll. ooo mitoo and asuna reunite. This is tense. I love it. SO TENSE HAHAHAHAHA.<br><br>MITO U SILLY BUGGER HAHAHAHAH. Good old asuna, not annoyed at all. But kirito and asuna are meant to beat the first floor boss. Ahh this is where she got the wind fleuret. absolute pogchamp. THE CLOAK RIP OFF OH MY GOD ii forget how badass every character in this fucking game is. i WANT IT. Sorry, pretty excited. Stoked to see kirito and asuna fucking destroying anything they want in h fucking d.<br><br>OKay. Calm down.<br><br>This is sick.<br><br>Kirito just got attack cancelled on like a GOON. A <b>GOON</b>. The state of this fool. But also agil and that attack the boss while kirito is getting his hp up in the og series right? And kirito still kills the boss poggers. WITH ASUNA, POGGERS. THEY DID THE THING HAHAHA.<br><br>Okay first floor boss fight so far has been very pog. True enough to the story to make me happy, ish, mito being involved so heavily kinda ruins the whole kirito and asuna bonding thing but whatevs. Okay so kirito-kibaou interaction now.<br><br>The annoying guy from the LN is pretty pog too, hope he stays consistent. KIRITO SAVE THE DAY WOOHOO. Take the blame. Be a hero. This guy has social comprehension beyond anything. oh cool they included morte thats pretty pog. Okay cool asuna goes with kirito for a bit. Pog. Mito is cool and i'm just relieved they didnt use the kirito-asuna LN stories but drop mito in. You know? Anyway, time for emotional kirito asuna moment i think. Isnt floor 2 boat one?<br><br>Oh thank god argo's there, i was worried. <br><br>Overall? 7/10. Pretty faithful, changed some things up i'm not super happy about, but i can totally get behind it. Lets just hope it stays relatively faithful.<br><br>alright, i'm done.<br><br>See ya.<br><br>-iv<br><br><br> </p>
