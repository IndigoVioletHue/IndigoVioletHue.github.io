	<p> So i'm fiddling with implementing comments. And boy, what a rabbit hole. Naively, i thought i could just insert some HTML with javascript and i'd be done. But NO! <br><br>I've looked into an SQL database. And its possible but i'd have to learn a lot. I dont get PHP at all and i'm noot even sure i can run it on the current host. Then comes Jekyll. Apparently the host im using has full support for it? So i'm looking into it now. Seems pretty cool<br><br>Sidenote. Why does PHP stand for <b> P</b>HP <b>H</b>ypertext <b>P</b>rocessing. Same problem with YAML. How can you have the abbreviation be a part of the expanded abbreviation? I dont know.<br>You can see me tinker with it at the bottom of the page. Obviously, eventually itll be the finished version. But for now, every time i update the blog itll be slightly different. Enjoy!<br>I'm possibly going to go insane. See you.<br><br>-iv<br> </p>
