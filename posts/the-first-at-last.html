	<p> This is the first post i'm creating using the new software i just made. Its janky and inefficient as hell but if it works then hallefuckingluyah. I've got a bit more programming to do as i write this but its semi functional at least. <br><br>UPDATE!<br><br>Just finished it, seems to all be working. This post will be the first real live test on the posting system. Might have to do some work with the formatting but shouldnt be too hard. OOH! And, i need to add the homepage button. oops.<br><br>c u soon!<br><br>-iv<br>
		<br><br> Update 2. I'm dumb. I'd already added the homebutton on the live site, but not the test page i was using. Good job me. Now to sort out the network side. Great. <br> <br> i hate networking. <br> peace. <br> -iv
		<br><br> Update 3. Server i was gonna use doesnt have a SATA cable to the SSD. Annoying. I'll see if i can just host it on this and partition some hard drive space or something. <br> -iv
